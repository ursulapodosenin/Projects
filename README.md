In the novel, the individuals on the outskirts of society are selected to participate in a cul-de-sac, forced to outsmart one another to stay alive and win the prize money at the end.

The edible plants are the Bansia and Grevillea flowers, Grass tree and Bracken fern. At the root of the Bracken fern you will find a real treat, Ghost Moth Larvae. Be warned however, the Bracken fern is also home to poisonous caterpillars which are deadly when ingested! Among other edible animals there are lizards, snails and, wallabies and snakes. Non-insect animals are difficult to catch and must be trapped to be eaten. Make sure to cut off the snakes head to avoid ingesting the deadly poison in their fangs!

All the better for you though, right? As you proceed through the Labyrinth, be careful, the group that traveled south may not be so kind upon running into you, after all they are famished and without knowledge of how to harvest food in the bungle bungle. They are the most dangerous when hungry.
