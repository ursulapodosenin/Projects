### Chi-Square Test 
```{r}

# Creating a new column that indicates if both the second and third attempt snatches were missed
data$Missed_Second_Third_Snatch <- ifelse(data$Second_Attempt_Snatch == 1 & data$Third_Attempt_Snatch == 1, 1, 0)

# Creating a contingency table between First_Attempt_Snatch and Missed_Second_Third_Snatch
contingency_table <- table(data$First_Attempt_Snatch, data$Missed_Second_Third_Snatch)

#Performing the Chi-Square test
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)

# Printing the contingency table and the result of the Chi-Square test
head(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)

# Creating a new column that indicates if both the second and third attempt clean and jerks were missed
data$Missed_Second_Third_CJ<- ifelse(data$Second_Attempt_CJ == 1 & data$Third_Attempt_CJ == 1, 1, 0)

# Creating a contingency table between First_Attempt_Snatch and Missed_Second_Third_Snatch
contingency_table2 <- table(data$First_Attempt_CJ, data$Missed_Second_Third_CJ)

# Performing the Chi-Square test
chi_square_test2 <- chisq.test(contingency_table2)

# Printing the contingency table and the result of the Chi-Square test
head(contingency_table2)
print(chi_square_test2)
```
# Using a Chi-Square test, from the p-values of p< 2.2e-16, which is less than the significance threshold of p<0.05, it is safe to say that you are likely to miss your second and third attempt snatch if you miss your first attempt. The same logic applies to the clean and jerk as well. 


### Logistic Regression 
```{r}

# Creating new columns indicating if both second and third attempts were missed for snatches and clean and jerks
data$Missed_Second_Third_Snatch <- ifelse(data$Second_Attempt_Snatch == 1 & data$Third_Attempt_Snatch == 1, 1, 0)
data$Missed_Second_Third_CJ <- ifelse(data$Second_Attempt_CJ == 1 & data$Third_Attempt_CJ == 1, 1, 0)

# Removing rows with NA values for snatches and clean and jerks separately
clean_data_snatch <- na.omit(data[, c("First_Attempt_Snatch", "Missed_Second_Third_Snatch")])
clean_data_cj <- na.omit(data[, c("First_Attempt_CJ", "Missed_Second_Third_CJ")])

# Fitting logistic regression models for snatch and clean and jerks
logistic_model_snatch <- glm(Missed_Second_Third_Snatch ~ First_Attempt_Snatch, data = clean_data_snatch, family = binomial)
logistic_model_cj <- glm(Missed_Second_Third_CJ ~ First_Attempt_CJ, data = clean_data_cj, family = binomial)

# Step 4: Calculate the probability of missing both second and third attempts if the first attempt was missed for snatches and clean and jerks
predicted_prob_snatch <- predict(logistic_model_snatch, newdata = data.frame(First_Attempt_Snatch = 1), type = "response")
predicted_prob_cj <- predict(logistic_model_cj, newdata = data.frame(First_Attempt_CJ = 1), type = "response")

# Printing the predicted probabilities
print(paste("Predicted probability for Snatch:", predicted_prob_snatch))
print(paste("Predicted probability for Clean & Jerk:", predicted_prob_cj))

```
# Conversely to the Chi-Square test, the logistic regression shows that there is an extremely small, essentially indicating that the likelihood of missing both the second and third attempts after missing the first attempt is almost zero. The logistic regression model is suggesting that, based on the data, missing the first attempt does not strongly predict missing both the second and third attempts. In other words, if an athlete misses their first attempt, the model estimates that the chances of them missing both subsequent attempts are extremely low.


### Probability 
```{r}

# Filtering out rows with NA values in relevant columns
df_clean <- data |>
  filter(!is.na(First_Attempt_Snatch) & !is.na(Second_Attempt_Snatch))

# Converting attempts to binary (1 if missed, 0 if not)
df_clean <- df_clean |>
  mutate(
    First_Missed = ifelse(First_Attempt_Snatch == 0, 1, 0),
    Second_Missed = ifelse(Second_Attempt_Snatch == 0, 1, 0)
  )

# Filtering to only include rows where the first attempt was missed
df_first_missed <- df_clean |>
  filter(First_Missed == 1)

# Calculating the probability of missing the second attempt given that the first attempt was missed
probability <- mean(df_first_missed$Second_Missed)

# Printing the result
print(probability)

```

# Based on this probability calculation, there is a 39% chance of missing your second and third attempts if you miss your first attempt. 

# To summarize the weightlifting data analysis:

# 1. Histograms of Best Snatch and Best Clean and Jerk:Best Snatch: 
# The distribution of best snatch weights is irregular with a more kurtotic distribution. This indicates variability in the best snatch weights across different weight classes.
# Best Clean and Jerk: The distribution shows a bimodal pattern for women and a negatively skewed distribution for men. This suggests that women’s clean and jerk results have two peaks, while men’s results are skewed to lower weights.

# 2. Bomb-Out Rates
# Snatch: Approximately 0.07% of lifters bombed out (missed all three attempts).
# Clean and Jerk: About 0.1% of lifters bombed out.
# This indicates a relatively low rate of complete failures in both events.

# 3. Chi-Square Tests:
# The Chi-Square tests for both snatch and clean and jerk attempts showed significant p-values (< 2.2e-16). This suggests a strong association between missing the first attempt and the likelihood of missing the subsequent attempts.

# 4. Logistic Regression:
# the logistic regression models predicted an extremely low probability of missing both second and third attempts after missing the first attempt. This result contrasts with the Chi-Square tests, indicating that while there is a significant association, the likelihood of failing the subsequent attempts after a first miss is very low according to the model.

# 5. Probability Calculation:
# For lifters who missed their first snatch attempt, the probability of missing the second attempt is approximately 0.39 (or 39%). This probability suggests that there is a moderate chance of missing the second attempt if the first attempt is missed.

### Summary:
# The data shows that while there is a significant association between missing the first attempt and missing subsequent attempts (as per the Chi-Square tests), the logistic regression suggests that this association does not strongly predict the probability of failing the second and third attempts. The calculated probability supports the logistic regression’s conclusion, showing that missing the first attempt does not heavily influence the chances of missing the next attempts.
